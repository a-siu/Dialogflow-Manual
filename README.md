# DialogflowES Manual Introduction

This project is a guide to create a dialogflowES agent for administrative purpose, specifically for HKU CHEM3443.

The bot created will be able to handle common questions from students such as their lab schedule, lab report due date and more. This would also be the foundation for the future development of chatbots with similar features.

The documentation folder will grow over time as more features are planned.
