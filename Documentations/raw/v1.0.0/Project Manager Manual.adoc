== Enabling Fullfillment

Enabling fullfillment is important as it is the core part of the logic processing for the chatbot. The fulfillment tab is on the left sidebar

There are 2 ways of using fulfillment

=== 1. Using Webhook

This requires having a server accessible by the chatbot, where the server will do most of the logic processing.

=== 2. Using Google Cloud

This allows code execution using ((Google Cloud Service)), though limited to only *Javascript*.

It is important to make backups regularly when developing a complex chatbot. You can do this by heading to *Settings(Cog Wheel) > Export and Import*
